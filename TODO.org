* Entity API
** Add default values to attributes
** People probably want validations by default: include ActiveModel::Validations

* Persistence API
** Handle Java exceptions in the Peer persistence library
** Handle exceptions from the REST client in the REST persistence library
** Refactor so that Diametric::Persistence is the primary module and the connection determines different behavior
*** Yoko requests: .connect should take an argument :rest or :peer, #peer? and #rest? methods should be on the connection object

* History API
** Make it
